# XRP-Arduino
An Arduino-based library for the XRP robot.

# Additional Dependencies
To use the XRP encoder, you must either write your own library, or use a library that someone else wrote.  A nice one to use is the [rp2040-encoder-library](https://github.com/gbr1/rp2040-encoder-library) by Giovanni di Dio Bruno.
